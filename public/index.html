                    This is an advanced computer graphics course, intended mainly for undergraduates with
                    a strong interest in computer graphics, as well as Masters and PhD students specializing
                    in the area, and in related fields. Specifically, it is intended to be a regularly taught
                    follow-on course to CSE 167 that all students who have interest in the area and have done
                    well in 167 are encouraged to take, as part of a full-year sequence in computer graphics.
                    The course is modeled after similar classes I have taught elsewhere, including
                    <a target="_blank" href="http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs283/sp13/">CS 283</a> at Berkeley, and COMS
                    4162 at Columbia University. However, the UCSD course is specialized to the quarter
                    system, and targeted more at advanced undegraduate material, rather than exploring research
                    frontiers. Above are some example images from the types of topics we will be covering.
