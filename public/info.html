                <h3>Prerequisites</h3>
                <p>
                    CSE 163 is intended as a follow-on to CSE 167, and as such CSE 167 or the equivalent is a pre-requisite
                    (you should have taken 167 or equivalent at another university, found the material interesting and done
                    well in the course). The course also has minimal overlap with CSE 190 (Jurgen Schulze's class on virtual
                    reality) that is taught simultaneously this spring. We have adjusted the timings so you can take both
                    courses this quarter. (Other classes that don't overlap include CSE 165 and CSE 169 in winter; you are
                    encouraged to take this course if you enjoyed those classes last quarter). In summary, the material in
                    CSE 163 does not have any major overlap with other courses, although the initial signal-processing part
                    may be a bit familiar if you have taken an image-processing course (CSE 166 is offered concurrently, so
                    this is unlikely). At the same time, CSE 163 is intended to be a one-stop advanced graphics course,
                    covering all topics in the field, and following on naturally from CSE 167. The course is intended to be
                    of interest to MS and PhD students in graphics, vision or robotics, in addition to advanced undergraduates.
                    If you like this course, I would highly recommend also registering for the advanced graduate courses like
                    CSE 274 and 291, which will be taught next year.

                <h3>Course Format and Requirements</h3>
                <p>
                    This is a regular lecture course, consisting of lectures on the relevant topics by the instructor. As
                    opposed to CSE 167, this course is intended to have a more intimate feel, with a smaller class size,
                    more in-class discussions and more independence and creative leeway in projects. We expect you to create
                    websites to turn in your work. We also do not provide skeleton code, except for homework 1.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Grading will be based entirely on 3 large programming projects. The last of these is a final project that
                    provides some flexibility in design to students (while also providing a number of concrete options). The
                    projects will cover signal/image processing, geometric modeling/meshes and real-time/image-based rendering.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Students taking the course for a letter grade are required to do all three projects (this may be in groups
                    of 2; the requirements remain unchanged if working alone, although we will consider in assigning the final
                    grade).
                    <strong>
                        Programs must be implemented entirely by students themselves; You may not copy source code
                        from previous instances of this or a similar class, other students, or other online etc. resources.
                        You may also not post your source code publicly, including to github or other public repositories.
                    </strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <i>
                        Please note that there is minimal hand-holding on the projects. They are large assignments for which
                        you are given 3-4 weeks, and they cannot be done at the last moment. You will need to start early and
                        work steadily. No late days will be given except in exceptional circumstances. Since you are supposed
                        to be working steadily, turn in what you have by the deadline, even if it is not perfect. If you do have
                        extraordinary circumstances, please contact the instructor well *before* the assignment is due.
                    </i>
                </p>
                <p>
                    We will also consider graduate students who want to take the course P/NP or S/U. Two of the three projects
                    are still required in this case. However, you may obtain credit for one ongoing project (another class or
                    research) in lieu of the final project. Therefore, graduate students taking the couse P/NP of S/U (they may
                    obtain the full 4 units) would in most cases need to do only one project in all (one of the first two regular
                    projects) to receive a passing grade. Please speak with me if you are interested in this option. Please
                    note that a passing score in this course requires an average grade of 50%, whether taking the class on
                    grades or pass-fail.
                    <i>
                        Thus, if choosing to take it pass-fail and do only two projects, you still need to get at least a 75%
                        average on these two projects; if that does not happen, then you will need to do the third project to
                        get an overall average of 50%.

                <p>
                    There are no books specifically required for this class. Readings including book chapters and papers are
                    provided where needed for each lecture. Optionally, a comprehensive computer graphics book such as
                    <i>Computer Graphics Principles and Practice</i> by Foley, van Dam et al. can be useful (a new edition
                    recently came out).
